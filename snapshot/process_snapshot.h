//!     process.
//!
//! This is the top-level object in a family of Snapshot objects, because it
//! gives access to a SystemSnapshot, vectors of ModuleSnapshot and
//! ThreadSnapshot objects, and possibly an ExceptionSnapshot. In turn,
//! ThreadSnapshot and ExceptionSnapshot objects both give access to CPUContext
//! objects, and ThreadSnapshot objects also give access to MemorySnapshot
//! objects corresponding to thread stacks.

  //!     user mode.
